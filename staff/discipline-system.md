# Discipline System

This document outlines Red Zone RP's approach to player discipline, including procedures for warnings, kicks, bans, and appeals. Our discipline system is designed to be fair, consistent, and transparent.

## Core Principles

Our disciplinary approach is founded on these principles:

1. **Education First**: Many violations occur due to lack of understanding, not malicious intent
2. **Proportional Response**: The punishment should fit the severity of the violation
3. **Consistency**: Similar violations should receive similar responses
4. **Documentation**: All disciplinary actions should be properly documented
5. **Appeal Path**: Players should have a clear path to appeal decisions they feel are unjust

## Violation Categories

We categorize rule violations by severity:

### Minor Violations
- Mild out-of-character (OOC) chat in-game
- Minor roleplay errors (small slip-ups)
- Accidental combat logging
- Non-disruptive vehicle collisions
- First-time minor violations of server rules

### Moderate Violations
- Repeated minor violations
- Intentional poor roleplay (not valuing life, etc.)
- Mild harassment of other players
- Using exploits unintentionally
- Disruptive behavior in voice chat
- Meta-gaming (first offense)
- Power-gaming (first offense)

### Serious Violations
- Repeated moderate violations
- Offensive language (racism, sexism, etc.)
- Intentional combat logging
- Harassment or targeted griefing
- Intentional random death match (RDM)
- Intentional vehicle death match (VDM)
- Severe meta-gaming/power-gaming
- Using exploits intentionally
- Evading previous punishments

### Severe Violations
- Repeated serious violations
- Extreme harassment or bullying
- Doxxing or real-life threats
- Hacking/modding/cheating
- Malicious use of exploits
- Attempting to crash the server
- Staff impersonation
- Real money trading

## Progressive Discipline System

Our discipline system follows a progressive model:

### Step 1: Verbal Warning
- **When to Use**: First-time minor violations
- **Documentation**: Brief note in player record
- **Delivery Method**: In-game message or voice chat
- **Goal**: Educate the player about the rule they violated
- **Follow-up**: None required unless violation continues

### Step 2: Written Warning
- **When to Use**: Repeated minor violations or moderate violations
- **Documentation**: Formal entry in warning database
- **Delivery Method**: In-game warning command with UI notification
- **Goal**: Clearly communicate that behavior must change
- **Follow-up**: Player must acknowledge receipt of warning

### Step 3: Kick
- **When to Use**: Continued violations after warning or one-time disruptive behavior
- **Documentation**: Kick record with reason
- **Delivery Method**: Server kick with reason displayed
- **Goal**: Create immediate consequence and time for reflection
- **Follow-up**: Discussion if player returns and continues behavior

### Step 4: Temporary Ban
- **When to Use**: Serious violations or pattern of disruptive behavior
- **Duration Options**:
  - 1 day (24 hours) - First temp ban
  - 3 days (72 hours) - Second temp ban
  - 7 days (1 week) - Third temp ban
  - 14 days (2 weeks) - Fourth temp ban
  - 30 days (1 month) - Final temp ban before permanent
- **Documentation**: Complete ban record with evidence
- **Delivery Method**: Ban notification with reason and appeal information
- **Goal**: Significant consequence that encourages serious reflection
- **Follow-up**: Review behavior upon return

### Step 5: Permanent Ban
- **When to Use**: Severe violations or continued serious violations after temporary bans
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive case file with all evidence
- **Delivery Method**: Ban notification with detailed reason and appeal information
- **Goal**: Remove persistently disruptive players from community
- **Follow-up**: Process any appeals according to procedure

## Special Cases

### Immediate Temporary Bans (Skip Steps 1-3)
- Using hacks/cheats (detected)
- Extreme harassment
- Severe trolling disrupting server experience
- Exploiting that damages server economy

### Immediate Permanent Bans (Skip Steps 1-4)
- Confirmed hacking/modding
- Doxxing or real-life threats
- Malicious attacks on server infrastructure
- Distribution of exploits
- Staff impersonation with malicious intent

## Documentation Requirements

### Required for All Warnings
- Player name and ID
- Date and time of violation
- Rule violated
- Brief description of incident
- Staff member issuing warning

### Required for All Kicks and Bans
- All warning information
- Detailed incident description
- Prior warning/discipline history
- Evidence (screenshots, video, chat logs)
- Witness statements (if applicable)
- Ban duration and reasoning

## Communication Guidelines

When addressing rule violations, staff should:

1. Remain calm and professional
2. Focus on the behavior, not the player
3. Clearly explain which rule was violated
4. Provide guidance on proper behavior
5. Avoid public humiliation or shaming
6. Use private channels for sensitive discussions
7. Document all significant interactions

## Appeal Process

### Who Can Appeal
- Any player who has received a temporary or permanent ban
- Appeals for warnings and kicks are handled informally

### How to Appeal
1. Submit appeal form on website or Discord
2. Include all relevant information about the incident
3. Explain why the decision should be reconsidered
4. Provide any additional evidence
5. Wait for appeal decision (typically 24-72 hours)

### Appeal Review Process
1. Appeal received and logged
2. Original staff member consulted
3. Evidence and circumstances reviewed
4. Senior staff decision made
5. Decision communicated to player
6. Ban adjusted or upheld accordingly

### Final Appeals
- Players may make one final appeal to Head Admins/Owner
- Must present new evidence or procedural concerns
- Decision at this level is final

## Staff Accountability

Staff members are held accountable for proper use of the discipline system:

1. **Consistency Audits**: Random reviews of disciplinary actions
2. **Peer Review**: Serious/permanent bans reviewed by multiple staff
3. **Training**: Regular training on proper discipline procedures
4. **Feedback**: Players can provide feedback about interactions
5. **Transparency**: Statistics on warnings/bans published monthly

## Documentation & Record Keeping

1. All disciplinary actions retained for 6 months minimum
2. Permanent bans retained indefinitely
3. Player records updated after each interaction
4. Monthly review of disciplinary trends
5. Regular cleaning of expired warnings (after 30 days)

Remember that our goal is to maintain a positive community while ensuring consequences for disruptive behavior. When in doubt, consult with senior staff before taking serious disciplinary action.
