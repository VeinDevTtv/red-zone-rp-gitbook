# Development Log

Welcome to the Red Zone RP development log. This section contains detailed information about our ongoing development process, future plans, and the evolution of our server.

## Purpose

The development log serves several important functions:

1. **Transparency:** We believe in keeping our community informed about what we're working on
2. **History:** Documenting our journey helps new players understand how we've evolved
3. **Accountability:** Public roadmaps help us stay focused on our development goals
4. **Feedback:** Dev logs create opportunities for community input on new features

## Current Focus

Our development team is currently focused on:

- Expanding the medical system with more realistic injuries and treatments
- Enhancing the criminal justice system with court proceedings
