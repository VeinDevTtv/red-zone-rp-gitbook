# Server Overview

## What is Red Zone RP?

Red Zone RP is a premium FiveM roleplay server that offers an immersive urban roleplay experience. Our server is set in a meticulously crafted environment that combines realistic gameplay with engaging storylines and deep character development.

## Server Lore

The city of Port Harbor was once a thriving industrial hub until economic collapse in the early 2000s led to widespread unemployment and rising crime. As corporations abandoned the city, gangs took control of various neighborhoods, creating the infamous "Red Zones" - dangerous areas with minimal police presence.

Today, Port Harbor is a city of stark contrasts. The wealthy downtown and harbor districts flourish with luxury and commerce, while the surrounding neighborhoods struggle with poverty and violence. This complex social landscape creates the perfect backdrop for dynamic and meaningful roleplay scenarios.

## Unique Features

## Server Philosophy

Unlike many roleplay servers that focus on quick action and constant excitement, Red Zone RP emphasizes the journey of your character. We believe that meaningful interactions, character development, and storytelling are the foundations of great roleplay.

Our mechanics and systems are designed to:
- Encourage genuine player interaction
