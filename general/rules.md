# Rules & Guidelines

## Core Principles

All rules of Red Zone RP stem from three fundamental principles:

1. **Respect:** Treat all players with courtesy and respect, regardless of circumstances
2. **Realism:** Maintain realistic roleplay that fits within our server's setting
3. **Immersion:** Preserve the immersive experience for everyone in the community

## General Rules

1. **Voice Chat:** In-game voice chat must be in character at all times
2. **OOC Chat:** Out-of-character (OOC) communication should be kept to the appropriate Discord channels
3. **Meta-Gaming:** Using information your character wouldn't know is strictly prohibited
4. **Power-Gaming:** Forcing scenarios on others or acting unrealistically to gain advantage is not allowed
5. **Harassment:** Personal attacks, discrimination, or targeted harassment will result in immediate ban

### Gameplay

1. **Character Consistency:** Maintain consistent character traits, history, and behavior
2. **Value of Life:** Your character should fear death and act accordingly in dangerous situations
3. **New Life Rule:** After being killed, your character cannot remember the circumstances leading to their death
4. **Combat Logging:** Disconnecting during RP scenarios to avoid consequences is prohibited
5. **Exploits:** Using bugs, glitches, or unintended mechanics is strictly forbidden

## Staff Expectations

Our staff team is held to the highest standards:

1. **Professionalism:** Staff must remain courteous and professional at all times
2. **Transparency:** All moderation actions will be documented and justified
3. **Consistency:** Rules will be enforced consistently across all players
4. **Separation of Duties:** Staff will not use their position for in-game advantage

## Consequences

Rule violations will be addressed with the following progression:

1. **Verbal Warning:** For minor first-time offenses
2. **Written Warning:** Documented warning for repeated minor offenses
3. **Temporary Ban:** 1-7 day ban for serious offenses
4. **Permanent Ban:** For extreme violations or repeated serious offenses

All bans can be appealed through our Discord server, but final decisions rest with senior staff.
