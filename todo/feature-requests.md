# Feature Requests

This page contains feature requests submitted by our community. Requests are organized by category and include their current status. We review all submissions and regularly implement the most popular or practical suggestions.

## How to Submit a Request

There are two ways to submit feature requests:
1. Use the `/suggest` command in-game
2. Post in the #feature-requests channel on our Discord server

Be specific and explain why you think the feature would benefit the server. The more detail you provide, the better we can evaluate your suggestion.
